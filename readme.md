Please note that all examples and laboratory exercises conducted during the laboratory sessions are 
not assessed. This coursework is the only marked assessment for this course. 
# Tasks to perform: 
## 1. You are required to study the code and implement the Goertzel algorithm in the C language 
in order to detect one frequency (GTZ_one_freq.zip). (Total mark 10%)
## 2. Complete the GTZ_all_freq.zip project to detect all 15 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, #, A, B, 
C and D). You are given a data.bin data file and a data_audio.wav audio file, corresponding 
to an 8-digit tone that you need to decode.
### a Copy the data.bin file into the CCS project. 
### b Complete the first 3 TODO sections in main_gtz.c and util.c to implement the 
Goertzel algorithm and decode the tone in the data file. (Total mark 30%)
### c Complete the last TODO section in util.c to generate an audio file based on the 
decoded tone. This audio should sound the same as the data_audio.wav. (Total mark 
10%)
## 3. Modify the C algorithm to increase the performance of the Goertzel algorithm (task 2b
main_gtz.c) using intrinsics and compiler switches. Measuring the number of cycles before 
and after the optimization. An example project of how to time your code is given in timing.zip. 
(Total mark 30%). 
## 4. Write a formal report explaining the implementation and showing/discussing the results. 
Presentation will be taken into account. (Total mark 20%). 
The report should follow the template given on Blackboard and should not exceed 6 pages; extra 
pages can be used in the appendix. 
Please submit one PDF report and one zip file with all the Goertzel projects. (Please DO NOT submit 
only the source files). Marks will be deduced if a project will not compile. Only ONE submission per 
group is required, with names and email addresses included in the report. Submission should be 
through Blackboard. Please note all members of the group are responsible for plagiarism check. 
The following two references show examples of implementation [1] [2].
